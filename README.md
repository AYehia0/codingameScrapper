# codingameScrapper
Scrape problems on codingame and append it to a file.txt, by using selenium webdriver.

# Important 
For now it scrapes the clash link you give, you can't scrape when you're clashing (wtf),,,

# Work
* Enter the clash when it starts
* Copy the link
* Close the clash 
* Pass it to the script
* Clash again

# ToDo
* Fix the upove problem
* Make it ```Browser-Extention```
